 *  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  Suppose you are designing a multiplayer game that has n â‰¥ 1 000 players, num-
 *  bered 1 to n, interacting in an enchanted forest. The winner of this game is the
 *  first player who can meet all the other players at least once (ties are allowed).
 *  Assuming that there is a method meet(i, j), which is called each time a player i
 *  meets a player j (with i 6 = j), describe a way to keep track of the pairs of meeting
 *  players and who is the winner.
